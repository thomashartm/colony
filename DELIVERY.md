# Delivery checkpoints

Document schema: `1`

colony is built one usable slice at a time. Scope and acceptance criteria live in
[REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md#12-delivery-plan-thin-vertical-slices).

After each item, stop, summarize what was built and left out, report validation
and open questions, and wait for user feedback before starting the next item.
Feedback may change the scope or order of later items. Keep milestone status and
implementation-process notes here; the README describes how to use the tool.

## W0 — Shell: complete

Delivered the Go CLI shell, configuration loading for repository and worktree
roots, `colony version`, help, executable smoke tests, CI and GoReleaser snapshots.

- Commit: `e4492c8`; release tag: `v0.0.0`.
- All nine [release-tag CI jobs passed](https://github.com/thomashartm/colony/actions/runs/36705427765):
  tests and vet on macOS/Linux, the Go 1.22 minimum on Linux, lint, four platform
  builds and snapshot packaging.
- Local validation passed with Go 1.25.5. Go 1.22 test execution on the local
  macOS failed with `missing LC_UUID load command`; its minimum-version check
  passed on Linux in CI.
- Session management, tmux integration, hooks and the TUI were deliberately
  left out of this slice.

Local checks, hosted CI and tags are reported separately. A local pass does not
establish a hosted CI result. Release numbering follows work-item numbering:
W0 is `v0.0.0`, W1 is `v0.1.0`, and so on.

## Next checkpoint — W1

Pending user direction. W1 introduces the first minion: worktree creation,
artifact copying, agent startup in tmux, manifests, listing, attach and switch.
The overview TUI follows in W2. Later items remain as specified in the requirements.

Continue using the original [wt 1.2.0](reference/wt) and
[wt-clean 1.0.0](reference/wt-clean) alongside colony until W10 delivers the full
worktree tooling.
